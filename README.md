# Testing GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll

## Prerequisites

Before you can use Jekyll to test a site, you must:

    Install Jekyll.
    Create a Jekyll site. For more information, see "Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll."

We recommend using Bundler to install and run Jekyll. Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, reduces Jekyll build errors, and prevents environment-related bugs. To install Bundler:

    1- Install Ruby. For more information, see "Installing Ruby" in the Ruby documentation.
    2- Install Bundler. For more information, see "Bundler."

## Building your site locally (Testing)

if required, run

    bundle install

Open Git Bash.

Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more information about publishing sources, see "About GitHub Pages."
Run your Jekyll site locally.

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve
    > Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
    >            Source: /Users/octocat/my-site
    >       Destination: /Users/octocat/my-site/_site
    > Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
    >      Generating...
    >                    done in 0.309 seconds.
    > Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/octocat/my-site'
    > Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
    >    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
    >  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.

    To preview your site, in your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000.

## Updating the GitHub Pages gem

Jekyll is an active open source project that is updated frequently. If the github-pages gem on your computer is out of date with the github-pages gem on the GitHub Pages server, your site may look different when built locally than when published on GitHub. To avoid this, regularly update the github-pages gem on your computer.

    Open Git Bash.
    Update the github-pages gem.
        If you installed Bundler, run bundle update github-pages.
        If you don't have Bundler installed, run gem update github-pages.
    
Update gem dependencies :
    https://bundler.io/guides/updating_gems.html
    sudo bundle update 



# Creative Theme for Jekyll

A Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com).

An attractive one page Bootstrap theme perfect for creative portfolios and businesses

Based on Creative Theme v5.1.8 and Bootstrap v4.3.1

## To use the Creative Theme template in your project

Creating a site with this particular Jekyll theme, is basically writing a markdown site.

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`.
- Don't forget to change `_data/footer.yml` to update the copyright.
- In `index.md` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
- You can also add other pages, like `links.md`.
- Edit `_data/menus.yml` to add links in the navigation bar.

# Credits
* This work is heavily inspired by https://github.com/volny/creative-theme-jekyll.
* Timeline template is based on https://github.com/anbasile/pickmeup.

* Links page background from https://www.rawpixel.com/.

# Development
If you want to use this template, or enhance it, you can use Docker.
Just run './build-in-docker.sh' and then point your browser to http://localhost:4000/.

Note: Developing for github pages is tricky. You should alway rely on
[safe plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) because any other, that's not
in the list will simply not run.

# Using Docker
https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve



## Creating a site:

cd to empty directory
docker run -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll new .

Start a local server with sane defaults listening on port 8080:

cd dir/of/your/jekyll/site
docker run -p 8080:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve

That's it!

Details: it will mount your current path into the containers /site, bundle install before running jekyll serve to , serve it at http://<docker-host>:8080.

To make this even easier, copy [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) from this repo to your jekyll site root. Then you'll only need to:

cd dir/of/your/jekyll/site


sudo systemctl restart docker
